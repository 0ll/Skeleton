Active Development
------------------
This directory houses items that we are working on in order to improve 
your experience using the non compass version of skeleton sass. Currently
we are working on:

* Multiple stop support for background gradients
* Support for radial gradients

If you wish to contribute to the development of these items please fork
the file on github. Be sure you **test** your functions/mixins
before you submit them. Working demos will get you a mention :)
