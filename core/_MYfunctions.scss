// This file is just a placeholder and not actually used. Please rename to _functions.scss
// and write custom functions that you wish to be scoped globally across all flavors (except css)
// This file can be used to override any and all mixins and functions. Please override variables in the project
// directories in _vars.scss in any given flavor (except css).

// Once file has been renamed to _functions.scss do the following:
// 		1. Open _config.scss and scroll to the bottom
//		2. Uncomment @import "functions"; to enable the use of custom code
//		3. Enjoy!

// @function myFunction() { }
